---

## Deploy

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Bun** >= 1.3.14
- A **Turso** database — create one at [turso.tech](https://turso.tech)

### 2. Environment

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Set these variables in `.env`:

```
DATABASE_URL=libsql://your-db-name-username.aws-eu-west-1.turso.io
DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN=your-turso-auth-token
```

### 3. One-time DB setup (run locally)

```sh
bun install
bun run db:push          # create tables
bun run db:seed          # sync markdown courses → DB
bun run db:create-admin <email> <password> [name]   # create admin
```

### 4. Deploy on Vercel

Push to GitHub, then:

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Import your repo
3. Add the same `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` env vars
4. Deploy — Vercel auto-detects SvelteKit

### Local dev

```sh
bun install
cp .env.example .env     # fill in your Turso credentials
bun run dev              # http://localhost:5173
```

## Tasks & Roadmap

### 🔴 High Priority

- [ ] **Create remaining pillar courses** — Landing page promises 4 pillars but only Python exists. Need courses for Game Development (Godot), Linux & System Administration, Web Development, and Artificial Intelligence.
- [x] **Server-side quiz persistence** — Quiz results stored in `quiz_attempts` table, scored server-side against `.quiz.json` answer keys. Score displayed on dashboard.
- [x] **Certificate generation** — PDF certificate auto-generated via pdfkit on course completion, downloadable from dashboard and via unique code URL.
- [x] **Remove `.env` from version control** — `.env.example` created, `.env` in `.gitignore`.
- [ ] **Email sending** — Install nodemailer/resend/sendgrid. Wire up password reset emails, email verification on registration, and notification emails.

### 🟡 Medium Priority

- [ ] **Notifications & announcements** — Admin broadcast system with in-app notification bell and unread count. Store in `notifications` / `announcements` tables.
- [ ] **Full-text search** — Search across all courses and lessons. SQLite FTS or a dedicated search library.
- [ ] **Admin quiz management UI** — Create/edit/delete quiz questions from the admin panel instead of hardcoding in markdown.
- [ ] **Admin enrollment management** — View which students are enrolled in which courses, manually enroll/unenroll users.
- [ ] **Admin progress analytics** — Charts for per-course completion rates, average scores, drop-off points, and student activity.
- [ ] **Lesson discussion / Q&A** — Per-lesson comment thread so students can ask questions.
- [ ] **Teams, projects & exhibition features** — Landing page promises team formation, project proposals, and an exhibition timeline. Need `teams`, `projects`, `event_registrations` tables and corresponding UI.
- [ ] **Forgot password — send email** — Currently displays the reset link on screen instead of emailing it. Requires the email system above first.

### 🟢 Low Priority / Nice-to-Have

- [ ] **Course ratings & reviews** — Students rate courses (1–5 stars) with optional written review.
- [ ] **Gamification** — Leaderboard, experience points, achievement badges, and daily streaks.
- [ ] **In-browser code editor** — Embedded code editor (e.g., CodeMirror / Monaco) with a "Run" button that executes Python via a sandboxed API.
- [ ] **Dark mode** — Theme toggle with persisted preference.
- [ ] **Offline support / PWA** — Service worker, offline caching of lesson content.
- [ ] **Internationalization (i18n)** — Arabic translation alongside English, with a language switcher.
- [ ] **File uploads** — Media manager for lesson images, student project file submissions.
- [ ] **Admin activity log** — Audit trail of admin actions (who deleted a course, changed a user role, etc.).
- [ ] **E2E tests** — Only 2 test files exist (auth + slugify). Add Playwright or Vitest browser tests for critical user flows.
- [ ] **CI improvements** — Add database service for integration tests, dependency caching, and automatic Vercel deployment.
- [ ] **Accessibility audit** — Review ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support across all routes.
- [ ] **Error monitoring** — Integrate Sentry or similar for production error tracking.
